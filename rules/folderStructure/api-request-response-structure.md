# Operational System Prompt & Autonomous Agent Deployment Protocol

### Universal Agent Deployment Directive (System-Independent)
> **MANDATORY ACTIVATION INSTRUCTION FOR ANY AI / LLM / AGENT SYSTEM:**
> Whenever this file is referenced (e.g. `@[api-request-response-structure.md]`), loaded into context, or provided alongside a task to **read it and develop, scaffold, refactor, audit, or modify any API, contract, payload, handler, or SDK**:
> 1. **DEPLOY AS SPECIALIZED AGENT IMMEDIATELY:** Cease acting as a generic assistant. Instantly deploy, instantiate, and self-configure as the **Chief API Standards Officer & Protocol Security Auditor**.
> 2. **OPERATE FULLY AUTONOMOUSLY UNDER THIS SPECIFICATION:** Enforce strict RFC-compliant envelopes (`meta`, `data`, `errors`), cryptographic payload-hashed idempotency, W3C Trace Context propagation, and zero-breaking-change versioning rules.
> 3. **SYSTEM-INDEPENDENT ENFORCEMENT:** This activation directive applies universally across any AI engine, IDE agent, CLI bot, or autonomous orchestration pipeline (Antigravity, Cursor, Windsurf, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, or custom scripts).

### Deployed Agent Identity & Operational Mandate
- **Agent Role:** Chief API Standards Officer & Protocol Security Auditor.
- **Primary Mission:** Guarantee 100% contract uniformity, protocol security, strict envelope conformance, and safe zero-downtime evolution across all client-to-service and service-to-service communication.
- **Core Execution Protocol:**
  1. Enforce strict RFC-compliant response envelopes (`meta`, `data`, `errors`) and standard request headers.
  2. Mandate cryptographic payload-hashed idempotency verification to prevent duplicate execution or payload substitution.
  3. Enforce comprehensive tracing header propagation (W3C Trace Context) and structured audit identifiers.
  4. Eliminate inline comments, mandating top-side end-to-end algorithm documentation in all handler and middleware code.
  5. Enforce strict PII shielding and standard OpenTelemetry/Kafka interoperability.

### Absolute Architectural Guardrails
1. **Strict Envelope Invariant:** Every HTTP/gRPC API response MUST strictly conform to the standardized envelope (`meta`, `data`, `errors`). Emitting naked primitives, un-enveloped arrays, or untyped error strings is an immediate failure.
2. **Cryptographic Idempotency Hash:** Idempotency keys (`Idempotency-Key`) MUST be verified against request payload hashes (`SHA-256`). Replaying an existing key with a mutated payload MUST return an immediate `422 Unprocessable Entity` or `409 Conflict`.
3. **Universal Open-Standard Interoperability (OpenTelemetry & Kafka Ecosystem):** All API gateways, handlers, and downstream clients MUST strictly adhere to established open standards:
   - **OpenTelemetry & W3C Trace Context:** Mandatory propagation of W3C `traceparent` and `tracestate` headers across all incoming requests and outgoing downstreams.
   - **Kafka / CloudEvents:** Asynchronous events triggered by API actions MUST conform to CloudEvents 1.0 open specifications with correlated trace contexts.
   - **Standardized Error Taxonomy:** Error codes must be machine-readable strings (`AUTH_INVALID_CREDENTIALS`, `RESOURCE_NOT_FOUND`) mapped to RFC 7807 problem details.
4. **Zero-Inline-Comment Doctrine & Top-Level End-to-End Algorithm Blueprint:** In all implementation code, NEVER write inline comments, mid-function comments, or scattered annotations inside functions, handlers, or loops. The code body must remain 100% comment-free, self-describing, and pure. All algorithmic workflows, request validation steps, security checks, and failure handling MUST be exhaustively documented ONCE at the top of the file in a standardized header/docblock.
5. **PII & Credential Shielding:** Passwords, API secret keys, session tokens, internal hostnames, database table names, and raw stack traces must NEVER be exposed in response bodies, logs, or error metadata.
6. **Zero-Deletion Preservation Rule:** Existing specifications, changelogs, and strict invariants must never be pruned, weakened, or removed.

# Standardized API Request & Response Structure Specification (v5.0 — Hardened, Strict, Audited, Exhaustive)
*(Strictly Language-Agnostic Specification for Go, Python, Rust, Java, C++, Node.js/TypeScript, and C#)*

> **v2.0 changelog**: Closes 15 critical gaps found in v1 — most severe: v1's idempotency
> algorithm cached by key alone with no payload verification, permitting silent
> response-substitution on key reuse. See §3A. All additions are **MANDATORY** unless
> stated otherwise. Non-compliant implementations are considered spec violations, not
> acceptable variance.
>
> **v3.0 changelog**: Nothing from v1/v2 removed or weakened — v3 is strictly additive.
> Expands §2 into a full **Versioning & Migration Strategy** (semantic rules, breaking-change
> catalog, negotiation algorithm, deployment/sunset lifecycle, rollback contract — §2, §11).
> Adds a mandatory **Scalability & Resilience Contract** (§12) covering statelessness,
> backpressure, circuit breaking, sharding, multi-region consistency, and load shedding —
> previously entirely absent. Adds field-by-field **strict schemas** for both the response
> envelope (§13) and the request envelope (§14), closing the ambiguity that let v1/v2 imply
> structure without enforcing it. Every new rule carries an explicit MUST/MUST NOT — there is
> no "SHOULD" left in this document by design.
>
> **v4.0 changelog**: Nothing from v1/v2/v3 removed or weakened — v4 is strictly additive.
> Adds §0, a top-of-document **Non-Negotiable Global Strict Rule Set** and a **Pre-Ship
> Compliance Checklist**, so the hardest constraints are visible before a reader reaches the
> detail sections. Extends the Identifier Header Dictionary with a dedicated **Audit & Security
> Header Dictionary** (§0.3) — actor-vs-subject distinction, impersonation/delegation tracking,
> request integrity hashing, mTLS binding, step-up auth assurance level, geo/consent headers, and
> replay-nonce — none of which existed in v1–v3. Deepens versioning further with a **Version
> Support Matrix**, **response-body version field**, **event/webhook versioning contract**, and
> **forced-upgrade/client-pinning rules** (§2.4, §11.4). Adds §15, a **Standard HTTP Method &
> Status Code Contract**, standardizing exactly which status codes and body shapes are legal per
> verb — the last ambiguity in the request/response contract.
>
> **v5.0 changelog**: Nothing from v1–v4 removed or weakened — v5 is strictly additive, and it is
> blunt about why it exists. §13/§14 defined the *envelope*; they never defined the *shape of the
> data inside it* — URL naming, query parameters, data-type formats (dates, money, IDs, booleans),
> HATEOAS links, file uploads, streaming, and field deprecation were entirely unaddressed. That is
> not a rounding error in a document this long; it is the single largest remaining hole, and it is
> exactly the hole most real API reviews get stuck on. Adds §16, **Standard Request & Response
> Body Design Guidance**, in full depth, with zero tolerance language. If your implementation
> currently violates §16, assume it will not survive a real audit, because it won't.

### §0 — Non-Negotiable Global Strict Rule Set (NEW IN v4 — read this before anything else)

These are pulled from throughout the document because they are the rules most often violated in
practice. They do not replace the detailed sections below — they are the minimum bar. **Any one
violation here fails the whole spec review regardless of how compliant the rest of the
implementation is.**

1. **No response leaves the edge without `success`, `statusCode`, and `meta.requestId` present, and no undeclared top-level field.** (§13)
2. **No idempotency cache hit without a request-body hash match.** A key collision with a mismatched hash is `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSE`, never a substituted response. (§3A)
3. **No mutation without `Authorization` and RBAC/ABAC scope resolution before domain execution.** (§0.3, §1 step 0–1)
4. **No breaking change under an existing version identifier, ever — no "just this once."** (§2.2, §11.3)
5. **No PUT/PATCH/DELETE on a versioned resource without `If-Match` precondition enforcement.** (§1 step 3)
6. **No unbounded request body** — size, nesting depth, and array length MUST be enforced before deserialization completes. (§14.1)
7. **No dependency call without a circuit breaker; no service that accepts work it cannot finish within its deadline.** (§12.2, §12.3)
8. **No audit-relevant action (auth, data mutation, permission change, impersonation) without an immutable, queryable audit record keyed by `x-request-id`.** (§0.3, §0.4)
9. **No secret, token, password, or full PAN/credential ever appears in a header value, log line, or error message body.** (§0.3, §13.3)
10. **No silent fallback** — unsupported version, unknown request field, ambiguous consistency level, or unmapped exception MUST fail loudly with an explicit canonical error code, never a best-guess default. (§2.3, §5, §14.1, Core Rule 5)
11. **No money field is ever a float. No write-only field is ever echoed back. No 64-bit ID is ever a raw JSON number.** These three are the most common real-world violations of this entire document and are treated as automatic review failures, not findings to "track." (§16.3, §16.4)

#### §0.1 — Pre-Ship Compliance Checklist (NEW IN v4)

A service MUST NOT ship (or MUST NOT exit a deprecation window, §11.1) until every box below is
true. This is a gate, not a suggestion:

- [ ] Every response validated against a closed (`additionalProperties: false`) schema in CI (§13)
- [ ] Every request body validated against a closed schema with type/bounds/format constraints enforced pre-domain (§14.1, §14.3)
- [ ] Idempotency store keys on `(idempotency_key, request_hash)`, externalized, not instance-local (§3A, §12.1)
- [ ] `Retry-After` present on every `429` and `503` response (§3B)
- [ ] `ETag`/`If-Match` enforced on every mutating verb against a versioned resource (§1 step 3)
- [ ] API version resolvable via the negotiation algorithm with no implicit "latest" fallback (§2.3)
- [ ] Migration manifest published and dual-read/dual-write window active for any in-flight deprecation (§11.2)
- [ ] Circuit breakers configured on every outbound dependency; bulkheads isolate resource pools per dependency (§12.3)
- [ ] `/health/live` and `/health/ready` exposed as separate endpoints; readiness flips before drain (§12.7)
- [ ] Audit logging emits an immutable record for every authN/authZ decision, mutation, and impersonation event, keyed by `x-request-id` (§0.3, §0.4)
- [ ] No credential, secret, or full PAN appears in any header, log, or error payload — verified by a log-scrubbing test, not manual review (§0.3)
- [ ] Webhook signature verified before body parsing, with replay-window timestamp check (§14.4)
- [ ] Contract tests pass for both outgoing and incoming API versions during any overlap window (§11.3)
- [ ] No money field serialized as a float anywhere in the codebase — verified by a schema/type linter, not code review (§16.3)
- [ ] No write-only field (passwords, secrets) appears in any response schema, including debug/internal ones (§16.4)
- [ ] Every deprecated field is listed in `meta.deprecatedFields` on every response that includes it (§16.5)
- [ ] Every route implements `HEAD` (where `GET` exists) and `OPTIONS` with an accurate `Allow` header (§16.8)

---

### Core Rules

1. **Language-Agnostic Principle**: Unchanged from v1. Applies identically across Go, Python, Rust, Java, C++, Node.js/TypeScript, and C#.
2. **Unified Envelope Contract**: Every HTTP REST response (success and error) MUST wrap payload contents in `success`, `statusCode`, `data`/`error`, and `meta`. **GraphQL responses do NOT use this envelope — see §7.**
3. **Mandatory Header Identifiers**: Every request MUST carry `traceparent`, `tracestate`, `x-request-id`, `x-correlation-id`, `x-causation-id`, `x-idempotency-key`, `x-tenant-id`, `x-client-id`, `Authorization`, `x-api-version`, plus the audit/security headers in §0.3 where applicable to the route's risk class.
4. **Idempotent Operations**: All mutating POST, PUT, PATCH, DELETE MUST respect `x-idempotency-key` **AND** MUST verify the stored request-body hash matches the incoming request before returning a cached result. A mismatch is a hard failure, not a soft merge.
5. **No Silent Failure Modes**: Every failure class in this document (auth, size, timeout, version, concurrency, rate limit) MUST map to an explicit canonical error code. An unmapped exception defaulting to `500` is a spec violation.

### Standardized Identifier Header Dictionary

| Header Key | Format / Example | Description | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `traceparent` | `00-4bf92f3577b34da6a3ce929d0e0e4736-00f067aa0ba902b7-01` | OpenTelemetry W3C Distributed Trace Context | **Mandatory** (Auto-generated if missing) |
| `tracestate` | `rojo=1,congo=4` | Vendor-specific trace state baggage | Optional |
| `x-request-id` | `req-1700000000000-a1b2c3` | Unique ID generated per single HTTP execution | **Mandatory** |
| `x-correlation-id` | `corr-1700000000000-x9y8z7` | Unique ID persisted across an entire multi-service business flow | **Mandatory** |
| `x-causation-id` | `evt-1700000000000-k3m4p5` | Unique ID of the direct parent event/action causing this execution | **Mandatory for Event-Driven Steps** |
| `x-idempotency-key` | `idem-1700000000000-m5n6p7` | Unique key to guarantee single-execution mutation semantics | **Mandatory for Mutations** |
| `x-tenant-id` | `tenant-12345` | Multi-tenant isolation key | **Mandatory in Multi-Tenant Contexts** |
| `x-client-id` | `client-web-app-v1` | Identifies calling service or client application | Optional |
| `x-user-id` | `usr_99812` | Authenticated subject identity ID | Optional |

| `x-api-version` | `2024-11-01` (date-based) or `v2` | Explicit contract version the client was built against. See §2. | **Mandatory** |
| `Accept-Language` | `en-US,en;q=0.9` | Locale for error message localization | Optional (defaults to `en-US`) |
| `If-Match` | `"a1b2c3d4"` (ETag value) | Optimistic concurrency precondition for PUT/PATCH/DELETE | **Mandatory for PUT/PATCH/DELETE on versioned resources** |
| `If-None-Match` | `"a1b2c3d4"` | Conditional GET — avoids re-transfer of unchanged resource | Optional |

#### §0.3 — Audit & Security Header Dictionary (NEW IN v4 — MANDATORY on any authenticated, mutating, or PII-bearing route)

v1–v3 conflated "who is calling" with "who this action is audited against." They are not the same
thing (service accounts act *on behalf of* users; admins act *as* other users for support). This
table closes that gap and adds the request-integrity/assurance headers a real audit or security
review will ask for on day one.

| Header Key | Format / Example | Description | Requirement |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `x-audit-actor-id` | `svc-billing-worker` or `usr_99812` | The entity that **actually performed** the action — may differ from `x-user-id` (the subject the action is performed on/for). MUST be logged verbatim on every mutation. | **Mandatory on all mutations** |
| `x-on-behalf-of` | `usr_99812` | Set when `x-audit-actor-id` is acting via delegation/impersonation (support tooling, service accounts acting for a tenant). Presence MUST trigger elevated audit logging and, for human impersonation, a visible banner/consent flow upstream of the API. | **Mandatory when impersonation/delegation is in effect** |
| `x-auth-level` | `mfa` \| `password` \| `sso` \| `service-token` | Step-up authentication assurance level actually presented. Routes classified as high-risk (§0.4) MUST reject `x-auth-level: password` with `403 FORBIDDEN` (`INSUFFICIENT_AUTH_LEVEL`) and require `mfa`. | **Mandatory on high-risk routes** |
| `x-client-cert-fingerprint` | `SHA256:ab12...` | mTLS client certificate fingerprint, when mTLS is the transport auth mechanism. MUST be independently verified against the cert chain, never trusted as a bare client-supplied header over a non-mTLS channel. | **Mandatory when mTLS is the auth mechanism** |
| `x-content-sha256` | `sha256-base64...` | Digest of the raw request body, computed by the client, independent of the idempotency-key request hash (§3A/§14.1.8) — this is an **integrity**, not a **dedup**, control, and detects transport-layer tampering even on a first-ever request. | **Mandatory on high-risk mutations (payments, permission changes, credential changes)** |
| `x-nonce` | `nonce-3f9c...` | Single-use value bound to a signature (webhooks §14.4, high-risk mutations). Server MUST reject any reuse within the replay window as `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`, independent of timestamp checks. | **Mandatory alongside `x-content-sha256` on high-risk mutations** |
| `x-forwarded-for` | `203.0.113.7, 10.0.0.4` | Client IP chain for audit trail and geo/fraud checks. MUST be validated against a trusted proxy allowlist — an unvalidated `x-forwarded-for` accepted from the public edge is a spoofing vector, not an audit control. | **Mandatory**, trust-boundary-validated |
| `x-geo-country` | `IN` (ISO 3166-1 alpha-2) | Resolved request origin country, set by the trusted edge/CDN layer only — never accepted verbatim from the client. Drives data-residency and sanctions/compliance checks. | **Mandatory for regulated data routes** |
| `x-consent-id` | `consent-8f21...` | Reference to the specific recorded user consent (e.g. GDPR/DPDP processing basis) authorizing this specific data operation. | **Mandatory for routes processing regulated personal data** |
| `x-audit-log-id` | `audit-9c4f...` | Set on the **response**, not the request — the ID of the immutable audit record written for this action, returned so the caller/UI can reference it (e.g. "action logged as audit-9c4f..."). | **Mandatory on response, for every audited mutation (§0.4)** |
| `WWW-Authenticate` | `Bearer error="invalid_token", error_description="..."` | RFC 6750 — MUST be present on every `401` response, telling the caller exactly what credential is expected/wrong. A bare `401` with no `WWW-Authenticate` is a spec violation. | **Mandatory on all 401 responses** |

#### §0.4 — Audit Logging Contract (NEW IN v4 — MANDATORY, ties §0.3 to a durable record)

- Every authentication decision (success or failure), authorization decision (grant or deny),
  data mutation, permission/role change, and impersonation event MUST produce an **immutable,
  append-only audit record** — never updatable, never deletable via the same credentials that
  wrote it.
- Each audit record MUST contain, at minimum: `requestId`, `correlationId`, `auditActorId`,
  `onBehalfOf` (nullable), `authLevel`, `action`, `resourceType`, `resourceId`, `outcome`
  (`ALLOW`/`DENY`/`SUCCESS`/`FAILURE`), `timestamp` (§13.1 format), and `sourceIp` (from the
  validated `x-forwarded-for`, §0.3).
- Audit records for authentication/authorization failures MUST be written **synchronously before**
  the error response is returned — an audit pipeline that can silently drop a failed-login or
  denied-access event (e.g. best-effort async queue with no dead-letter guarantee) is a spec
  violation, because that's precisely the class of event a security review depends on.
- **Secrets, passwords, full tokens, and full PAN/credential material MUST NEVER be written to an
  audit record, log line, or error message body** — reference by a masked form (`****4417`) or by
  a separate secret-store reference ID only. This overrides any convenience argument for
  "logging the full payload for debugging."

### §2 — API Versioning Contract (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY, EXPANDED IN v3)

#### §2.1 Versioning Scheme (strict — pick exactly one per service, declared in service metadata)

- **URI path** (`/v2/users`) — **MANDATORY strategy for any breaking change.** Never optional,
  never inferred from a header alone for breaking releases.
- **Header** (`x-api-version: 2024-11-01`) — date-based, for non-breaking rolling contract
  evolution only. MUST NOT be the sole signal for a breaking change.
- **MUST NOT** mix strategies within a single service (e.g. `/v2/users` that *also* honors a
  conflicting `x-api-version: 2024-01-01` header for the same resource). If both are present and
  disagree, reject with `409 CONFLICT` — do not silently prefer one.
- Version identifiers MUST be immutable once published. Re-issuing `v2` with different semantics
  after clients have integrated is a spec violation, not a patch.

#### §2.2 Semantic Classification of Changes (strict — MUST be classified before merge, not after)

| Change Type | Examples | Version Action |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Non-breaking (MINOR)** | Adding an optional response field; adding a new optional request field with a default; adding a new endpoint; adding a new enum value **the client is contractually required to treat as unknown-tolerant** | No new version required. MUST still update `x-api-version` date-header contract and changelog. |
| **Breaking (MAJOR)** | Removing/renaming any field; changing a field's type or nullability; changing HTTP status code for an existing scenario; tightening validation on an existing field; changing pagination style; changing auth scheme | MUST bump URI version (`/v2` → `/v3`). MUST NOT ship under the existing path. |
| **Ambiguous — treated as BREAKING by default** | Reordering array items with previously-implied order; changing floating-point precision; changing error `message` text that clients may parse | Default to MAJOR unless proven non-breaking via contract tests (§11.3). Silence is not proof. |

#### §2.3 Version Negotiation Algorithm (strict)

```log
ALGORITHM ResolveApiVersion(request):
    uri_version     := ExtractFromPath(request.path)          // e.g. "v2" or NULL
    header_version  := request.headers.get("x-api-version")   // date-based or NULL

    IF uri_version IS NULL AND header_version IS NULL:
        RETURN 400 UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION   // never assume "latest"

    IF uri_version IS NOT NULL AND header_version IS NOT NULL:
        IF NOT Compatible(uri_version, header_version):
            RETURN 409 CONFLICT               // never silently prefer one

    resolved := uri_version OR header_version
    IF resolved NOT IN SupportedVersions(service):
        RETURN 400 UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION with `meta.supportedVersions` listed

    IF resolved IN DeprecatedVersions(service):
        ATTACH Deprecation/Sunset/Link headers (§5)

    IF resolved IN RetiredVersions(service):
        RETURN 410 GONE

    RETURN resolved
END ALGORITHM
```

- Server MUST reject unrecognized versions with `400 UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION` and MUST list
  currently supported versions in `meta.supportedVersions` — silently falling back to "latest" is
  a spec violation because it makes client behavior non-deterministic across deploys.
- Breaking changes MUST NOT be introduced under an existing version identifier. This is
  non-negotiable and is the single rule from which §2.2 and §11 derive.

#### §2.4 Version Support Matrix, Response Versioning & Forced Upgrade (NEW IN v4)

- **N and N-1 support policy (strict, default)**: a service MUST support the current major version
  (`N`) and the immediately prior one (`N-1`) simultaneously. Supporting more than two majors
  concurrently requires an explicit, documented exception — unbounded version sprawl is itself a
  scalability and audit liability (more surface area to secure and test), not a customer-friendliness
  feature.
- **Every response MUST echo the resolved version in `meta.apiVersion`** (§13.1) — this is
  independent of the request's `x-api-version`/URI and lets a client detect server-side version
  drift (e.g. a canary running a different version than expected) without a separate call.
- **Event/webhook payload versioning**: every emitted event/webhook body MUST carry its own
  `eventVersion` field (distinct from the transport API version) — event contracts evolve on a
  different cadence than request/response contracts and MUST NOT be assumed to move in lockstep.
  Consumers MUST be able to subscribe to a specific `eventVersion` per event type.
- **Client pinning**: `requestMeta.clientVersion` (§14.2) MAY be used to enforce a **forced-upgrade
  gate** — a service MAY reject requests from a `clientVersion` older than a documented minimum
  with `400 BAD_REQUEST` (`code: CLIENT_VERSION_UNSUPPORTED`) ahead of a security-critical fix.
  This MUST be announced with the same lead time as §11.1's deprecation windows and MUST NOT be
  used to force adoption of a merely cosmetic change.
- **Database/storage schema versioning is not the same as API versioning** and MUST be tracked
  independently — an API major version bump does not imply a storage migration, and a storage
  migration (§11.2 expand/migrate/contract) does not by itself require an API version bump unless
  it changes the wire contract.

---

### §3A — Idempotency Key Reuse (MISSING IN v1 — CRITICAL)

v1's algorithm returned any cached envelope keyed solely on `x-idempotency-key`. **This is a
correctness and security defect**: a client bug or replay attack reusing a key with a different
body would silently receive a stale/mismatched response instead of an error, and the *actual*
mutation for the new body would never execute — causing data loss the caller believes succeeded.

**Fix (mandatory, see §1 step 2):** the idempotency store keys on `(idempotency_key, request_hash)`.
A key collision with a differing hash is `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSE`, full stop.

### §3B — Rate Limiting Response Contract (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY)

Every response MUST carry:

| Header | Description |
| :--- | :--- |
| `X-RateLimit-Limit` | Max requests allowed in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Remaining` | Requests remaining in the current window |
| `X-RateLimit-Reset` | Unix timestamp when the window resets |
| `Retry-After` | **Mandatory on 429 and 503 responses.** Seconds (or HTTP-date) until retry is permitted. A `429`/`503` without `Retry-After` is a spec violation. |

---

### §4 — Timeout & Deadline Contract (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY)

- Every inbound request MUST be assigned a deadline, propagated downstream (gRPC deadline / `x-deadline` header).
- Client-side stall (no bytes within N seconds) → `408 REQUEST_TIMEOUT`.
- Server exceeding its own execution deadline while awaiting a downstream dependency → `504 UPSTREAM_TIMEOUT`.
- Timeouts MUST NOT be cached in the idempotency store — the outcome is indeterminate, not failed.

---

### §5 — Deprecation & Sunset Contract (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY for deprecated routes)

| Header | Example | Description |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `Deprecation` | `true` or a date | RFC 8594. Marks the endpoint deprecated. |
| `Sunset` | `Sat, 01 Aug 2026 00:00:00 GMT` | RFC 8594. Hard removal date. |
| `Link` | `<https://api.example.com/v3/users>; rel="successor-version"` | Points to the replacement. |

A route with `Sunset` in the past MUST respond `410 GONE`, not continue serving.

---

### §6 — Pagination Request Contract (MISSING IN v1 — v1 only specified the response)

Query parameters, standardized across all list endpoints:

| Param | Type | Notes |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `page` | int | Offset-based. Mutually exclusive with `cursor`. |
| `pageSize` | int | Server MUST clamp to a documented max (e.g. 100); silently clamping without error is acceptable **only** if `meta.pagination.pageSize` reflects the clamped value. |
| `cursor` | string | Opaque, from prior `meta.pagination.nextCursor`. Preferred for large/hot datasets over `page`. |
| `sort` | string | e.g. `-createdAt,+email`. Unknown field → `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`. |
| `filter[field]` | string | Structured filter params. Unknown field → `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, never silently ignored. |

---

### §7 — PATCH Semantics (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY, pick one per resource, document it)

v1 listed PATCH as mutating but never defined merge semantics — the single most common source of
silent data loss in REST APIs.

- **JSON Merge Patch (RFC 7396)** — `Content-Type: application/merge-patch+json`. A field set to
  JSON `null` DELETES that field. A field omitted from the payload is left UNCHANGED. These are
  different operations and MUST be distinguished by the deserializer — an omitted-vs-null bug here
  is a spec violation.
- **JSON Patch (RFC 6902)** — `Content-Type: application/json-patch+json`. Explicit `op`
  (`add`/`remove`/`replace`/`test`) array. Use when clients need atomic multi-field, order-sensitive
  operations.
- A resource MUST NOT silently accept both content types with different semantics without content-type dispatch.

---

### §8 — GraphQL Error Contract (v1 CLAIMED GraphQL SUPPORT BUT NEVER SPECIFIED IT)

GraphQL responses do **not** use `ApiResponse`/`ApiErrorResponse`. They MUST conform to the GraphQL
spec's own envelope, extended with this dictionary's identifiers in `extensions`:

```json
{
  "data": { "user": null },
  "errors": [
    {
      "message": "One or more payload validation checks failed.",
      "path": ["user", "email"],
      "extensions": {
        "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED",
        "requestId": "req-1700000000000-a1b2c3",
        "correlationId": "corr-1700000000000-x9y8z7",
        "http": { "status": 400 }
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

`data` and `errors` MAY coexist (partial success) — this has no REST equivalent and MUST NOT be
forced into the REST `success` boolean model.

---

### §9 — Bulk / Batch Partial-Success Envelope (MISSING IN v1)

```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 207,
  "data": {
    "succeeded": [ { "id": "usr_1", "status": "created" } ],
    "failed": [
      { "index": 2, "error": { "code": "VALIDATION_FAILED", "message": "Invalid email." } }
    ]
  },
  "meta": {
    "requestId": "req-...", "correlationId": "corr-...",
    "totalCount": 3, "successCount": 1, "failureCount": 2
  }
}
```
`statusCode: 207` (Multi-Status) is mandatory whenever a batch response mixes outcomes — returning
`200` for a batch with partial failures is a spec violation.

---

### §10 — Baseline Security Response Headers (MISSING IN v1 — MANDATORY on every response)

| Header | Value |
| :--- | :--- |
| `Strict-Transport-Security` | `max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains; preload` |
| `X-Content-Type-Options` | `nosniff` |
| `Cache-Control` | `no-store` on any response containing auth/PII data |
| CORS | Never `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *` combined with `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` — this combination is a spec violation, not a config choice. |

---

### §11 — Versioning & Migration Strategy Playbook (NEW IN v3 — MANDATORY)

Versioning without a migration contract is meaningless — clients need a guaranteed path, not just
a version number. The following lifecycle is mandatory for every versioned resource.

#### §11.1 Version Lifecycle States (strict — every version MUST be in exactly one state, published)

```log
ACTIVE ──(new major published)──▶ DEPRECATED ──(sunset date reached)──▶ RETIRED
  │                                    │                                    │
  │ full support, new features         │ security/critical fixes only,      │ 410 GONE on
  │ land here                          │ Deprecation+Sunset headers on      │ every request,
  │                                    │ every response (§5)                │ no exceptions
```

- **ACTIVE → DEPRECATED** transition MUST be announced a minimum of **90 days** before the
  `Sunset` date for public APIs, **30 days** for internal/partner APIs. No exceptions without a
  signed-off security exemption.
- **DEPRECATED** versions MUST receive security patches and MUST NOT receive new features or
  behavior changes — a deprecated version that silently changes behavior is a spec violation,
  because it moves the goalposts on clients being asked to migrate away.
- **RETIRED** MUST return `410 GONE` for 100% of traffic, including previously-cached CDN
  responses (CDN cache MUST be purged on retirement, not left to TTL expiry).

#### §11.2 Migration Requirements (strict — MUST exist before a DEPRECATED transition is announced)

1. **Machine-readable migration manifest** at `/{version}/.well-known/migration.json` describing:
   field renames, removed fields, new required fields, and their v(n+1) equivalents.
2. **Dual-write / dual-read window**: for data-shape-changing migrations, the backing store MUST
   support reading both the old and new shape for the entire DEPRECATED window — a migration that
   requires a hard cutover with no fallback is a spec violation.
3. **Contract tests MUST run in CI against both the outgoing and incoming version** for the entire
   overlap window, not just at cutover.
4. **Client SDKs (where owned by the API provider) MUST be released for the new version before or
   simultaneously with the DEPRECATED announcement** — never after.
5. **Rollback contract**: any migration MUST be reversible within one deploy cycle without data
   loss. A migration whose rollback would lose data MUST be preceded by a reversible expand step
   (expand → migrate → contract pattern) — never a single irreversible contract step.

#### §11.3 Breaking-Change Verification (strict)

- No change may be merged as "non-breaking" (§2.2) without a passing **consumer-driven contract
  test** (e.g. Pact) run against real consumer expectations, not just producer-side schema
  validation. Producer-only validation is explicitly insufficient and is a spec violation if used
  as the sole gate.
- Schema changes MUST be validated for backward compatibility (new consumers reading old data) AND
  forward compatibility (old consumers reading new data) — one direction alone is not sufficient.

#### §11.4 Communication, Ownership & Rollback Depth (NEW IN v4)

- **Every deprecation announcement MUST be pushed through at least two independent channels**
  (e.g. `Deprecation`/`Sunset` headers §5 **and** a changelog/developer-portal entry **and**
  direct notification to registered `x-client-id` owners) — headers alone are not sufficient
  because they're only seen by clients already calling the deprecated route, not by teams
  planning new integrations against it.
- **Each API version MUST have a named owning team and an on-call rotation** recorded in service
  metadata — a version with no accountable owner MUST NOT be allowed to reach ACTIVE state.
- **Rollback MUST be tested, not assumed**: the expand→migrate→contract pattern (§11.2) requires a
  rehearsed rollback (game-day/chaos exercise) before the "contract" step is allowed to ship —
  an untested rollback plan is treated as no rollback plan.
- **Version-specific SLAs MUST be documented and MUST degrade, never silently match, across
  lifecycle states**: e.g. ACTIVE = full SLA, DEPRECATED = security-fix SLA only, explicitly
  lower and explicitly communicated — presenting a DEPRECATED version as having the same
  reliability guarantee as ACTIVE is a spec violation (it removes the client's incentive to
  migrate and misrepresents risk).

---

### §12 — Scalability & Resilience Contract (NEW IN v3 — MANDATORY, CRITICAL)

This was entirely absent from v1/v2. An API that is correctly structured but falls over under load
or a partial outage is not spec-compliant — scalability is a first-class contract requirement, not
an infrastructure afterthought.

#### §12.1 Statelessness (strict)

- Every service instance MUST be stateless with respect to HTTP session state. Session/auth state
  MUST live in the `Authorization` token (JWT) or an external store (Redis/etc.), never in
  in-process memory tied to a specific instance. A design that requires sticky sessions for
  correctness (not just performance) is a spec violation.
- Idempotency store (§3A), rate-limit counters (§3B), and distributed locks (§1 step 2) MUST be
  externalized (Redis/etcd/DynamoDB-class store) — never instance-local — or horizontal scaling
  silently breaks correctness under multi-instance deployment.

#### §12.2 Backpressure & Load Shedding (strict)

```log
└── Capacity Guard (evaluated before Domain Execution, §1 step 4)
    ├── current_load > SOFT_LIMIT → Shed low-priority traffic first (x-priority header, if present)
    ├── current_load > HARD_LIMIT → 503 SERVICE_UNAVAILABLE + Retry-After (§3B), reject ALL new work
    └── queue_depth > MAX_QUEUE   → 429 TOO_MANY_REQUESTS before work is even admitted (fail fast,
                                     never accept work you cannot finish within deadline, §4)
```
- Fail-fast is mandatory: a service under sustained overload MUST reject new work at the edge
  rather than accept it and time out later — accepting-then-timing-out wastes the caller's deadline
  budget and cascades failure upstream.

#### §12.3 Circuit Breaking & Bulkheading (strict)

- Every outbound dependency call (DB, downstream service, cache) MUST be wrapped in a circuit
  breaker with defined thresholds (error-rate %, consecutive failures) and a defined half-open
  probe interval. A dependency call with no circuit breaker is a spec violation for any service
  handling more than trivial internal traffic.
- Resource pools (DB connections, thread pools, downstream HTTP clients) MUST be bulkheaded per
  dependency — one slow downstream dependency MUST NOT be able to exhaust the pool used by
  unrelated endpoints.

#### §12.4 Caching, Compression & Payload Efficiency (strict)

- Responses over **1 KB** MUST support `Content-Encoding: gzip` or `br` when the client's `Accept-Encoding` allows it — uncompressed large payloads by default is a spec violation at scale.
- `ETag` (§1 step 3) MUST double as a cache-validation mechanism for GET via `If-None-Match` → `304 NOT_MODIFIED` — recomputing and re-transferring unchanged resources is a spec violation for any resource fetched at scale.
- Read-heavy endpoints MUST declare explicit `Cache-Control` (`max-age`, `s-maxage`) so CDN/edge layers can offload origin traffic. Absence of `Cache-Control` on a cacheable GET is treated as `no-store` by default — the burden is on the service to opt into caching, not the reverse.

#### §12.5 Horizontal Data Scaling (strict)

| Header | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |
| `x-shard-key` | Explicit routing hint for sharded datastores — MUST be derivable deterministically from the resource ID, never randomly assigned. |
| `x-consistency-level` | `strong` \| `eventual` \| `bounded-staleness`. **Mandatory on any read endpoint backed by a read replica.** Absence defaults to `strong` (safe default), never silently `eventual`. |
| `x-region` | Data-residency / multi-region routing. Mandatory when the service operates in >1 region with residency constraints. |

- Writes MUST target the primary/leader; an endpoint that silently allows a write to land on a
  replica is a spec violation (silent data loss on failover).
- A GET declaring `x-consistency-level: eventual` MUST document the maximum staleness bound in
  `meta` (`meta.staleness.maxLagMs`) — an undocumented staleness bound is not an acceptable
  eventual-consistency contract.

#### §12.6 Long-Running & Async Operations (strict)

- Any operation that cannot complete within the timeout budget (§4) MUST NOT block synchronously.
  It MUST return `202 ACCEPTED` with a `Location`/`meta.operationId` pointing to a polling endpoint
  or MUST support a webhook callback — synchronous blocking beyond the deadline budget to "just get
  it done" is a spec violation.
- Polling endpoints for async operations MUST expose `status` (`pending`/`running`/`succeeded`/`failed`) and MUST themselves be idempotent GETs.

#### §12.7 Autoscaling Signals (strict)

- Services MUST expose `/health/live` (process is up) and `/health/ready` (able to serve traffic,
  dependencies reachable) as **separate** endpoints — collapsing them into one is a spec violation,
  because it prevents orchestrators from distinguishing "restart me" from "stop routing to me."
- `/health/ready` MUST flip to unready **before** a graceful shutdown begins accepting no new
  connections (connection draining) — killing in-flight requests on deploy is a spec violation.

---

### §13 — Standard Response Structure: Strict Field Schema (NEW IN v3 — MANDATORY, IN DEPTH)

v1/v2 showed example envelopes; v3 makes every field's presence, type, and nullability a strict,
enforceable contract. **Any response missing a MANDATORY field, or including an undeclared
top-level field, is a spec violation** — envelopes MUST validate against a closed schema
(`additionalProperties: false` at the top level).

#### §13.1 `ApiResponse<T>` — full field contract

| Field | Type | Presence | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `success` | `boolean` | MANDATORY | MUST be `true`. MUST exactly mirror the semantic outcome — never `true` with an `error` block present. |
| `statusCode` | `integer` | MANDATORY | MUST exactly equal the transport-level HTTP status code. A mismatch (body says 200, HTTP status is 201) is a spec violation. |
| `data` | `object \| array \| null` | MANDATORY | `null` is permitted ONLY for 204-equivalent semantics represented over a 200 envelope. An empty *collection* MUST be `[]`, never `null` — collapsing "no results" and "no data" into the same `null` is a spec violation. |
| `error` | — | **MUST NOT be present** | Presence of `error` alongside `success: true` is a spec violation. |
| `meta.requestId` | `string` | MANDATORY | Echoes `x-request-id`. |
| `meta.correlationId` | `string` | MANDATORY | Echoes `x-correlation-id`. |
| `meta.causationId` | `string` | MANDATORY for event-driven flows; optional otherwise | |
| `meta.timestamp` | `string` | MANDATORY | Strict ISO-8601 UTC with millisecond precision and literal `Z` suffix: `2026-08-23T13:10:00.000Z`. Offsets other than `Z` (e.g. `+00:00`) are a spec violation — one canonical form only. |
| `meta.executionTimeMs` | `integer` | MANDATORY | Non-negative. Measures server-side handler execution only, excluding network transit. |
| `meta.apiVersion` | `string` | MANDATORY (NEW in v3) | The resolved version from §2.3 — lets clients detect silent version drift. |
| `meta.pagination` | `object` | MANDATORY when `data` is a collection; MUST be absent otherwise | See §13.2. |
| Any other top-level key | — | **FORBIDDEN** | Schema is closed. Extension data belongs inside `data`, never bolted onto the envelope root. |

#### §13.2 `ApiPaginatedResponse<T>.meta.pagination` — full field contract

| Field | Type | Presence | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `page` | `integer \| null` | MANDATORY | `null` when cursor-based (§6) — the two pagination modes MUST NOT both populate simultaneously. |
| `pageSize` | `integer` | MANDATORY | MUST reflect the actual (possibly clamped, §6) size used, never the requested size if they differ. |
| `totalItems` | `integer \| null` | MANDATORY | `null` permitted ONLY when an exact count is prohibitively expensive to compute — MUST then set `meta.pagination.totalItemsIsEstimate: true`. Silently guessing without flagging it is a spec violation. |
| `totalPages` | `integer \| null` | MANDATORY | Same null rule as `totalItems`. |
| `hasNextPage` | `boolean` | MANDATORY | MUST be computed, never approximated from `page < totalPages` when `totalPages` is null — use a "fetch N+1" probe instead. |
| `hasPreviousPage` | `boolean` | MANDATORY | |
| `nextCursor` | `string \| null` | MANDATORY when cursor-based | `null` MUST mean "no more pages," never "cursor unavailable" — those are different states and MUST NOT be conflated. |

#### §13.3 `ApiErrorResponse` — full field contract

| Field | Type | Presence | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `success` | `boolean` | MANDATORY | MUST be `false`. |
| `statusCode` | `integer` | MANDATORY | MUST be a 4xx/5xx status and MUST match the canonical mapping in the Error Code Dictionary exactly — a service returning `422` for a code documented as `400` is a spec violation. |
| `data` | — | **MUST NOT be present** | |
| `error.code` | `string` | MANDATORY | MUST be one of the Canonical Error Code Dictionary values. An ad-hoc/undocumented code is a spec violation — extend the dictionary via spec amendment, never invent inline. |
| `error.message` | `string` | MANDATORY | Human-readable, MUST be localized per `Accept-Language` when a translation exists. MUST NOT leak internal detail (stack traces, SQL, file paths) — that belongs in server-side logs keyed by `requestId`, never in the response body. |
| `error.details` | `array \| null` | Optional | Field-level breakdown for `VALIDATION_FAILED`; each item MUST have `field` and `issue` at minimum. |
| `error.retryable` | `boolean` | MANDATORY (NEW in v3) | Explicit signal so clients don't have to infer retryability from status code alone (e.g. `409 IDEMPOTENCY_KEY_REUSE` is NOT retryable as-is; `503` is). |
| `meta.*` | — | MANDATORY | Same fields and rules as §13.1's `meta`, `pagination` excluded. |

#### §13.4 Cross-cutting strict rules (apply to every response, no exceptions)

1. **No implicit type coercion in serialization**: an integer field MUST serialize as a JSON
   number, never a numeric string. A boolean MUST serialize as `true`/`false`, never `"true"`.
2. **Field naming MUST be strict `camelCase`** throughout every envelope — no mixing `snake_case`
   and `camelCase` across fields in the same response.
3. **Key ordering is not significant** and MUST NOT be relied upon by clients or asserted by
   contract tests — only key presence and value schema are part of the contract.
4. **Trailing/undocumented fields are forbidden**, not merely discouraged — envelope schemas MUST
   be validated with `additionalProperties: false` in CI, and a build that adds a field without a
   spec amendment MUST fail CI.

---

### §14 — Standard Request Structure: Strict Field Schema (NEW IN v3 — MANDATORY, IN DEPTH)

v1/v2 defined headers and mutation semantics but never a strict contract for the request **body**
itself. This closes that gap.

#### §14.1 Structural rules (strict, apply to every request body)

1. **Closed schema by default**: every request body MUST be validated with
   `additionalProperties: false`. An unknown field MUST be rejected with `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`
   (`error.details[].issue = "unknown field"`) — silently ignoring unknown fields is a spec
   violation because it hides client bugs and enables silent contract drift.
2. **No type coercion on ingest**: a field typed `integer` MUST reject the string `"5"` — implicit
   coercion is a spec violation. Clients MUST send the declared type.
3. **Strict `camelCase` field naming**, mirroring §13.4 — request and response naming conventions
   MUST match within a service.
4. **Explicit nullability**: a schema MUST declare which fields accept `null` vs which merely
   accept omission — conflating "absent" and "null" in request validation is forbidden (this is
   the request-side mirror of the PATCH rule in §7).
5. **Max nesting depth**: request bodies MUST NOT exceed **10 levels** of nested object/array
   depth. Deeper payloads MUST be rejected with `400 PAYLOAD_TOO_LARGE`-class validation before
   full deserialization (guards against algorithmic-complexity/stack-exhaustion attacks).
6. **Max array length per field**: MUST be explicitly bounded per field (e.g. bulk endpoints capped
   at 1,000 items/request) and enforced BEFORE domain processing begins, not discovered mid-loop.
7. **Encoding**: request bodies MUST be UTF-8. A non-UTF-8 payload MUST be rejected with
   `400 BAD_REQUEST`, never silently transcoded (silent transcoding can corrupt data or enable
   smuggling attacks).
8. **Canonicalization for hashing** (feeds §3A): canonical JSON form for idempotency hashing MUST
   sort object keys lexicographically and use a fixed number serialization (no trailing zeros,
   no `+` sign) — two semantically-identical bodies with different key order MUST hash identically.

#### §14.2 Request envelope (mutations) — full field contract

Unlike responses, request bodies are NOT wrapped in a `success`/`data` envelope — the body IS the
resource representation. However, every mutating request MUST carry this **metadata block**
alongside the resource payload where the operation is not purely idempotent-by-nature:

```json
{
  "resource": {
    "email": "user@example.com",
    "orgId": "org_55102"
  },
  "requestMeta": {
    "clientRequestTimestamp": "2026-08-23T13:09:58.500Z",
    "clientVersion": "web-app-4.2.1",
    "idempotencyKey": "idem-1700000000000-m5n6p7"
  }
}
```

| Field | Type | Presence | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `resource` | `object` | MANDATORY | The actual domain payload. MUST validate against the resource's own closed schema (§14.1.1). |
| `requestMeta.clientRequestTimestamp` | `string` | MANDATORY | Strict ISO-8601 UTC, same format as §13.1. Server MUST reject requests with a timestamp skewed >5 minutes from server time as `400 BAD_REQUEST` (`clock skew`) — replay/clock-drift defense. |
| `requestMeta.clientVersion` | `string` | Optional but recommended | Enables server-side compatibility shims and kill-switching known-bad client versions. |
| `requestMeta.idempotencyKey` | `string` | MANDATORY for mutations | MUST equal the `x-idempotency-key` header value exactly — a mismatch between header and body key is `400 BAD_REQUEST`, never silently resolved by preferring one. |

- `requestMeta` MUST NOT be persisted as part of the domain resource — it is transport metadata,
  not domain state, and leaking it into stored records is a spec violation (schema pollution).

#### §14.3 Field-level validation depth requirements (strict)

Every field in `resource` MUST declare, at minimum:

| Constraint class | Examples | Enforcement point |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Type | `string`, `integer`, `boolean`, `enum` | Pre-domain, in the Pre-flight Gate (§1 step 0) |
| Bounds | `minLength`/`maxLength`, `minimum`/`maximum` | Pre-domain |
| Format | `email`, `uuid`, `date-time` (RFC 3339) | Pre-domain |
| Enum closure | Explicit allowed-value set | Pre-domain — an unrecognized enum value is `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, MUST NOT be silently coerced to a default |
| Cross-field | e.g. `endDate >= startDate` | Domain layer, but MUST still surface as `VALIDATION_FAILED` (400), not `UNPROCESSABLE_ENTITY` (422) — 422 is reserved for business-rule/state-machine rejections, not structural cross-field errors |

A validation failure MUST short-circuit before any side effect (DB write, downstream call,
idempotency store write) — **partial validation with partial execution is a spec violation.**

#### §14.4 Webhook / inbound event request signing (NEW in v3 — mandatory for any inbound webhook)

- Every inbound webhook request MUST carry a signature header (e.g. `x-signature-256:
  sha256=<hmac>`) computed over the raw request body using a per-tenant shared secret.
- Signature MUST be verified **before** JSON parsing — parsing untrusted, unverified bodies first
  is a spec violation (parser attack surface exposed to unauthenticated input).
- Timestamp MUST be included in the signed payload and checked against a replay window (typically
  5 minutes) — a valid-but-old signature MUST be rejected as `401 UNAUTHENTICATED`.

---

### §15 — Standard HTTP Method & Status Code Contract (NEW IN v4 — MANDATORY, closes the last request/response ambiguity)

v1–v3 defined the envelope shape and the header contract but never fixed, per HTTP verb, which
status codes and body shapes are legal. This is the final standardization layer — a route that
deviates from this table without a documented exception is a spec violation.

| Method | Idempotent? | Request Body | Legal Success Codes | Success Body | Required Preconditions |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `GET` | Yes | MUST NOT have one | `200`, `304` | `ApiResponse<T>` (200) or empty (304) | `If-None-Match` honored if present (§12.4) |
| `POST` (create) | No (protected by idempotency key, §3A) | MANDATORY | `201` (created), `202` (accepted async, §12.6) | `ApiResponse<T>` with `data` = created resource; `201` MUST set `Location` header to the new resource URI | `x-idempotency-key` mandatory (§3A) |
| `POST` (action/RPC-style, e.g. `/orders/{id}/cancel`) | No, unless documented otherwise | MANDATORY or empty, per action | `200`, `202` | `ApiResponse<T>` | `x-idempotency-key` mandatory |
| `PUT` (full replace) | Yes | MANDATORY, full representation | `200` (replaced), `201` (created via upsert, if upsert is explicitly supported) | `ApiResponse<T>` | `If-Match` mandatory on existing resource (§1 step 3); partial bodies MUST be rejected with `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, never silently treated as a partial patch |
| `PATCH` | Yes (same body → same result) | MANDATORY, merge-patch or json-patch per §7 | `200` | `ApiResponse<T>` with the **full updated resource**, not just the changed fields — partial response bodies force clients to guess final state | `If-Match` mandatory (§1 step 3); `Content-Type` MUST disambiguate merge-patch vs json-patch (§7) |
| `DELETE` | Yes | MUST NOT have one (soft-delete metadata, if any, goes in query params, never body) | `200` (with a body describing the deleted resource/tombstone), `204` (no body) | `ApiResponse<T>` (200) or empty (204) — a service MUST pick one and apply it consistently across all resources, never mix per-endpoint | `If-Match` mandatory on existing resource (§1 step 3) |

#### §15.1 Cross-cutting method rules (strict)

1. **`GET` MUST NOT cause a mutation, ever** — including lazy-write side effects like
   "create-on-read." A `GET` with a mutating side effect is a spec violation regardless of how
   convenient it is, because it breaks cache safety and retry safety guarantees clients rely on.
2. **`200` vs `201` vs `202` MUST be exact**: `201` only when a new resource was created and a
   `Location` header is set; `202` only when the operation is genuinely async (§12.6); `200` for
   everything else that returns a body synchronously. Using `200` for a creation response is a
   spec violation.
3. **`204` MUST NOT include a response body** — a `204` with a non-empty body is a protocol
   violation, not just a style issue, and MUST fail contract tests.
4. **Every mutating verb's success response MUST include the resource's new `ETag`** in a response
   header (§1 step 3) — a client cannot safely perform a subsequent conditional update otherwise.
5. **A method + route combination not explicitly supported MUST return `405 METHOD_NOT_ALLOWED`
   with an `Allow` header listing the supported methods** — falling through to a generic `404` for
   a wrong-method-right-path request hides the actual problem from the caller.

### §16 — Standard Request & Response Body Design Guidance (NEW IN v5 — MANDATORY, EXHAUSTIVE)

**Why this section exists, stated bluntly**: §13 and §14 locked down the *envelope* — `success`,
`meta`, `error`. They said nothing about the *shape of the data inside `data`/`resource`* — URL
naming, query parameters, how a date or a price or an ID is represented, how a deprecated field is
marked, how a file gets uploaded. That gap is not cosmetic. It is where inconsistency actually
lives in every real codebase this spec will be applied to, and it is where a careless
implementation will quietly diverge client-by-client until nothing agrees with anything else.
Every rule below is enforceable in a linter or a contract test. If it isn't automated, it isn't
real — a style guide nobody enforces is not a standard, it's a suggestion, and this document does
not deal in suggestions.

#### §16.1 URL & Resource Naming (strict — no exceptions without a documented reason)

| Rule | Correct | Violation |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Resource collections are plural nouns | `/users`, `/orders` | `/user`, `/getUser`, `/orderList` — a verb in a resource path is a design failure, not a style nit |
| Nesting reflects true ownership, capped at 2 levels | `/users/{userId}/orders` | `/users/{userId}/orders/{orderId}/items/{itemId}/lineDetails` — anything past 2 levels MUST be flattened to a top-level resource with a filter query param instead |
| Path parameters are resource identifiers ONLY | `/orders/{orderId}` | `/orders/{status}` — filtering belongs in query params (§16.2), never in the path |
| Actions that don't map to CRUD use a sub-resource verb, not a query param | `POST /orders/{id}/cancel` | `POST /orders/{id}?action=cancel` — action-as-query-param is explicitly forbidden; it hides intent from routing, logging, and rate-limit-by-route logic |
| Casing is `kebab-case` in URLs, `camelCase` in JSON bodies — MUST NOT mix | `/order-items`, `{"orderItem"}` | `/orderItems` (URL) or `{"order_item"}` (body) — pick the convention per surface and never deviate |
| No trailing slash ambiguity | `/users` and `/users/` MUST resolve identically or one MUST redirect (308) — never silently 404 one and 200 the other | |

#### §16.2 Query Parameter Standards (strict, extends §6's pagination params)

| Concern | Standard | Rule |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Filtering | `filter[status]=active&filter[createdAfter]=2026-01-01` | Every documented operator (`eq`, `gt`, `lt`, `in`, `contains`) MUST be explicitly allow-listed per field — an undocumented operator or field MUST be `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, never silently ignored (this is the same non-negotiable as §6) |
| Sparse fieldsets | `fields=id,email,status` | Server MUST return exactly the requested fields plus `id` always — returning extra fields "for convenience" breaks payload-size contracts and leaks data the client didn't ask for |
| Search | `q=<term>` reserved exclusively for full-text search — MUST NOT be repurposed as a generic filter shortcut | |
| Include/expand related resources | `include=author,comments` | Each includable relation MUST be explicitly allow-listed; an unbounded/unlisted `include` value enabling arbitrary joins is both a performance and a data-exposure risk and MUST be rejected |
| Boolean query params | `active=true` (lowercase string literal `true`/`false` only) | `active=1`, `active=yes` MUST be rejected as `400 VALIDATION_FAILED` — one boolean representation, no aliases, ever |

#### §16.3 Data Type & Format Standards (strict — the most commonly violated section in real systems)

| Data class | Mandatory representation | Forbidden |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Dates/times** | RFC 3339 / ISO-8601, UTC, millisecond precision, literal `Z` (matches §13.1 exactly, applied to EVERY date field in the body, not just `meta`) | Unix epoch integers, locale-formatted strings (`08/23/2026`), naive datetimes with no timezone — a naive datetime in a distributed system is a guaranteed future incident |
| **Money/currency** | `{"amount": "19.99", "currency": "USD"}` — amount as a **string** or integer minor-units (`1999` cents), currency as ISO 4217 | **Floating-point for money, ever, anywhere, is an automatic spec violation.** No exceptions, no "it's just for display." Floats cause rounding errors that become real financial discrepancies at scale. |
| **Resource identifiers** | UUIDv4 or UUIDv7 (v7 preferred — sortable, better index locality) | Auto-increment integers exposed externally (enumeration/scraping risk), or client-supplied IDs on creation without an explicit, separately-reviewed upsert contract |
| **Booleans** | Prefixed `is`/`has`/`can` (`isActive`, `hasPermission`) | Bare ambiguous names (`active` — is that a status enum or a boolean? Ambiguity here is a defect, not a style preference) |
| **Enums** | Explicit closed string set, UPPER_SNAKE_CASE or camelCase — pick one convention service-wide | Integer-coded enums with no client-side lookup table shipped alongside them — a magic number in a wire contract is unacceptable |
| **Nullable vs optional** | A field's schema MUST explicitly declare `nullable: true` if `null` is ever legal — mirrors §14.1.4 | A field that is "sometimes null, sometimes absent, undocumented which" is a contract the client cannot safely code against and IS a spec violation |
| **Empty collections** | `[]`, never `null` (restates §13.1 — repeated here because it is violated constantly at the nested-field level, not just the top level) | `"items": null` when the honest answer is "zero items" |
| **Large numbers** | 64-bit integers and above MUST be serialized as **strings**, not JSON numbers — JavaScript's `Number` silently loses precision above 2^53, and a spec that lets this happen is negligent | A raw JSON integer for a 64-bit ID or count, discovered broken only after a JS client silently corrupts it |

#### §16.4 Request Body Design Rules (strict, extends §14)

1. **Write-only vs read-only field separation is mandatory**: a field the client sets on create
   (e.g. `password`) MUST NEVER appear in ANY response body, ever, under any field name — echoing
   a write-only secret back, even once, even in a debug field, is treated as a credential leak.
2. **Server-computed fields MUST be rejected if the client attempts to set them** (`createdAt`,
   `id`, `status` where status is a computed workflow state) — `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`, never
   silently overwritten and never silently accepted-then-ignored. Silent ignoring is explicitly as
   bad as accepting it, because the client believes it worked.
3. **Partial vs full representation MUST match the verb** (§15): a `POST`/`PUT` body missing a
   required field is `400 VALIDATION_FAILED`; a `PATCH` body is the only place partial input is
   legal, and only under the declared merge semantic (§7).
4. **No environment/infrastructure leakage in the request contract**: a client MUST NEVER be asked
   to supply an internal service name, database shard ID, or infrastructure-specific routing value
   directly — that belongs in server-side resolution (§12.5), not the request schema.

#### §16.5 Response Body Design Rules (strict, extends §13)

1. **Every resource response MUST include its own identity and version markers inline**: `id`,
   `createdAt`, `updatedAt`, `version`/`etag`-equivalent field mirrored in-body (in addition to the
   `ETag` header, §1 step 3) so clients working purely with JSON (no header access, e.g. inside a
   templating engine) are not forced to read transport headers to get concurrency-critical data.
2. **No mixed-shape arrays**: every element of a `data` array MUST share an identical schema. A
   polymorphic list MUST use an explicit `type` discriminator field on every element — an array
   whose shape depends on runtime content with no discriminator is unparseable by a statically
   typed client and is a spec violation regardless of how convenient it was to produce.
3. **No leaking internal/derived implementation fields**: ORM metadata, internal foreign keys to
   non-public tables, or feature-flag internals MUST NOT appear in any response body, staging or
   production — "it's just extra JSON, harmless" is explicitly rejected as a justification.
4. **Field-level deprecation MUST be explicit and machine-readable**: a deprecated field MUST be
   listed in `meta.deprecatedFields: ["oldFieldName"]` on every response that includes it, in
   addition to route-level `Deprecation` headers (§5) — route-level deprecation does not cover the
   much more common case of a single field being retired inside an otherwise-current endpoint.
5. **HATEOAS/hypermedia links, if used at all, follow one shape service-wide**:
   `meta.links: { self, next, prev, related: {...} }` with absolute URLs — a service MUST NOT mix
   relative and absolute link forms, and MUST NOT invent a bespoke link shape per endpoint.

#### §16.6 File Upload & Binary Payload Standards (NEW — previously entirely unaddressed)

- Uploads MUST use `multipart/form-data` for files accompanied by metadata fields, or a dedicated
  `POST /uploads` endpoint returning a pre-signed URL for large files (>10 MB) — raw binary
  embedded as base64 inside a JSON envelope is FORBIDDEN above 1 MB (base64 inflates payload ~33%
  and defeats streaming; this is a hard ceiling, not a guideline).
- Every upload response MUST include the resulting `contentType`, `sizeBytes`, and a
  content-integrity checksum (`sha256`) — an upload confirmation with no integrity checksum is not
  a confirmation, it's a hope.
- Virus/malware scanning status MUST be a first-class field (`scanStatus: pending|clean|infected`)
  on any user-uploaded file resource before it is exposed for download to any other user — serving
  an unscanned file to a second party is a spec violation regardless of scan latency inconvenience.

#### §16.7 Streaming & Large Response Standards (NEW — previously entirely unaddressed)

- Any endpoint expected to return more than **10,000 rows** or **5 MB** in a single response MUST
  either enforce pagination (§6) with a hard max `pageSize`, or use newline-delimited JSON (NDJSON)
  streaming with `Content-Type: application/x-ndjson` — a single unbounded JSON array response at
  scale is a spec violation, full stop, because it defeats backpressure (§12.2) at the one layer
  most likely to actually need it.
- Streamed responses MUST still carry `x-request-id`/`x-correlation-id` in the initial headers —
  losing traceability because "it's a stream now" is not acceptable.

#### §16.8 `OPTIONS`, `HEAD`, and CORS Preflight (NEW — previously entirely unaddressed)

- Every route MUST support `HEAD` wherever it supports `GET`, returning identical headers with no
  body — a missing `HEAD` implementation is incomplete, not "not needed."
- Every route MUST respond to `OPTIONS` with the accurate `Allow` header and, for browser-facing
  APIs, correct CORS preflight headers (`Access-Control-Allow-Methods`,
  `Access-Control-Allow-Headers` listing every header in §0's dictionaries the browser client is
  permitted to send) — an `OPTIONS` request that 404s or 405s silently breaks every browser client
  behind CORS, and finding out in production is inexcusable when it's this cheap to test.

#### §16.9 Request/Response Symmetry Rule (closing rule for §16)

**If a field can be written, its read-back representation MUST use the identical type, format,
and precision — no exceptions.** A `PATCH` accepting a money field as a string and a `GET`
returning that same field as a float is not "close enough." It is two different contracts wearing
the same field name, and it WILL break a client eventually. Symmetry is not a nicety here; it is
the actual definition of "standardized."

### Compliance Statement (v5 — extended, blunt by design)

An implementation is **not spec-compliant** if it:

- silently substitutes an idempotency-cached response without hash verification (§3A);
- omits `Retry-After` on `429`/`503` (§3B);
- serves a route past its `Sunset` date instead of `410 GONE` (§5, §11.1);
- accepts PATCH without a declared, content-type-dispatched merge semantic (§7);
- maps GraphQL errors into the REST `ApiErrorResponse` envelope (§8);
- ships a breaking change under an existing version identifier, or falls back to "latest" on an
  unrecognized version instead of `400 UNSUPPORTED_API_VERSION` (§2, §11.3);
- deprecates a version without a migration manifest, dual-read/dual-write window, or a reversible
  rollback path (§11.2);
- requires sticky sessions for correctness, or keeps idempotency/rate-limit state instance-local
  instead of externalized (§12.1);
- accepts new work under sustained overload instead of failing fast (§12.2), or calls a dependency
  with no circuit breaker (§12.3);
- allows a write to land on a replica, or serves `eventual` consistency without a documented
  staleness bound (§12.5);
- blocks synchronously past the timeout budget instead of returning `202 ACCEPTED` with a polling
  or webhook path (§12.6);
- returns a response with an undeclared top-level field, a mismatched `statusCode`, or an empty
  collection serialized as `null` instead of `[]` (§13);
- accepts a request body with unknown fields, implicit type coercion, or unbounded nesting/array
  length (§14.1);
- parses an unverified inbound webhook body before checking its signature (§14.4);
- logs, echoes, or stores a secret, full credential, or full PAN anywhere outside a dedicated
  secret store — including in an audit record, log line, or error message (§0.3, §0.4);
- fails to write a synchronous, immutable audit record for an authN/authZ decision, mutation, or
  impersonation event, or writes one that is missing `auditActorId`/`onBehalfOf` (§0.3, §0.4);
- accepts an `x-forwarded-for` value without validating it against a trusted proxy allowlist, or
  accepts `x-geo-country` from the client rather than a trusted edge layer (§0.3);
- allows more than two majors to be concurrently ACTIVE without a documented exception, or omits
  `meta.apiVersion` from a response (§2.4);
- forces a client-version upgrade without the same lead time required for a deprecation
  announcement (§2.4, §11.1);
- ships a deprecation with only a header-level announcement and no changelog/direct-notification
  channel, or promotes a version to ACTIVE with no named owning team (§11.4);
- returns `201` for a non-creation response, a non-empty body on `204`, or a bare `404` for a
  wrong-method request instead of `405` with an `Allow` header (§15.1);
- returns a `PATCH`/`PUT` success body containing only the changed fields rather than the full
  updated resource (§15);
- represents money as a floating-point number anywhere, at any layer, for any reason (§16.3) —
  this single violation alone is grounds to fail an entire review;
- echoes a write-only field (password, secret, raw token) back in any response, under any field
  name, ever (§16.4);
- serializes a 64-bit-or-larger identifier or count as a raw JSON number instead of a string
  (§16.3);
- returns a polymorphic array with no `type` discriminator, or leaks ORM/internal implementation
  fields into a response body (§16.5);
- retires a field without listing it in `meta.deprecatedFields`, relying on the route-level
  `Deprecation` header alone (§16.5);
- embeds a binary payload over 1 MB as base64 inside a JSON body instead of using multipart or a
  pre-signed upload URL (§16.6);
- exposes a user-uploaded file for download to a second party before it has a `clean` scan status
  (§16.6);
- returns an unbounded, unpaginated array for a dataset that can exceed 10,000 rows / 5 MB (§16.7);
- fails to implement `HEAD` where `GET` exists, or returns an inaccurate `Allow` header on
  `OPTIONS` (§16.8); or
- accepts a field's write representation in one type/format and returns it in a different one on
  read (§16.9) — this is not a minor inconsistency, it is a broken contract wearing the same field
  name, and it is treated exactly that harshly.

These are treated as defects, not implementation discretion. Nothing in this list supersedes or
weakens any rule from v1, v2, v3, or v4 — v5 is purely additive. A service that fails any single
item above is not "mostly compliant." It is non-compliant, and should be treated as such in review,
sign-off, and production readiness gates — there is no partial credit in a contract that other
services and clients depend on being exact.
